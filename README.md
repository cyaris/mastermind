I first learned how to code while reading the book Learn Python the Hard Way. For the section on object oriented programming, I took on the challenge of translating the classic board game, Mastermind, into a command line game. I originally hoped to integrate this original Python version into my site with Flask. Since Github doesn't support Flask, I decided to learn Javascript and create a web version of Mastermind using D3.js. The code for both versions of the game are included in this repository.

Two existing D3.js projects really helped me in seeing this project through.
