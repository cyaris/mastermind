      Never played Mastermind before?<br /><br />The computer will pick a secret color code with a specific order. The
      length of this code will vary according to the level. Each turn, you'll use the color wheel to try and guess the
      color code while the computer scores your guess in two columns. The W column denotes right colors in the wrong
      place and the B column denotes right colors in the right place. To win, guess the entire color code correctly
      before you run out of turns. Have fun!
