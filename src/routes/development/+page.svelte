      I first learned how to code while reading the book Learn Python the Hard Way. For the section on object oriented
      programming, I took on the challenge of translating the classic board game, Mastermind, into a command line game.
      I originally hoped to integrate this original Python version into my site with Flask. Since Github doesn't support
      Flask, I decided to learn Javascript and create a web version of Mastermind using the D3.js library. The code for
      both versions of the game are included [here](https://github.com/cyaris/mastermind).
